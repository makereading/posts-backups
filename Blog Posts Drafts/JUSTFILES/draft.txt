Title: JUST

**Just** is a handy way to save and run project-specific commands. Commands are stored in a file called justfile or Justfile with syntax inspired by make:

Examples: https://github.com/casey/just/tree/master/examples


How it works: 

1. We just need to create a file named ```justfile``` or ```JustFile```. 
2. Then we need to add command(s) in a groupwise manner under a name, as given below.

```

hello:
	echo "Hello !"
	echo "This will be excuted next"
```
